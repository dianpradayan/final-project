      <h1>CHARLIE PUTH</h1>
      <img src="charlie.png">
      <h6>Charles Otto Puth Jr. (born December 2, 1991) is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. 
          His initial exposure came through the viral success of his song videos uploaded to YouTube.

        After initially signing with eleveneleven after performing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Puth began 
        contributing to songs and albums for other artists such as Cody Simpson, Livingston Taylor, and Skizzy 
        Mars; as well as creating lite solo material and covers of popular songs. With primary intent on a solo 
        career, Atlantic Records and Artist Partner Group eventually sought the artist and released his debut 
        single, "Marvin Gaye" featuring Meghan Trainor in 2015. Coinciding with the single came his first feature, 
        "See You Again", which he co-wrote, co-produced, and performed with Wiz Khalifa for the Furious 7 
        soundtrack as a tribute to Paul Walker. It peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 for 12 
        non-consecutive weeks. After the success of "See You Again", he gained worldwide recognition for multiple 
        subsequent releases, including his next single "One Call Away". The single reached number 12 on the 
        Billboard Hot 100.</h6>

        Puth's debut studio album, Nine Track Mind, was released in January 2016 to negative reviews from critics, 
        and was preceded by the singles "One Call Away" and "We Don't Talk Anymore" featuring Selena Gomez, which 
        peaked at number 12 and number nine, respectively on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2017, he released two songs, 
        "Attention" and "How Long", with the former peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. Both were 
        included in his second studio album, Voicenotes (2018), which was released to generally positive reviews 
        from critics and peaked at number four on the Billboard 200. In 2019, Puth released the singles "I Warned 
        Myself", "Mother" and "Cheating on You". The following year, Puth released singles "Girlfriend" and "Hard 
        on Yourself."  </h6>

    <h6>According to Puth, he initially wanted to be a jazz player, but because of his parents who had an immense 
        interest in pop, he started developing an interest in pop as well. He recorded and produced his own 
        Christmas album when he was only in the sixth grade. By selling copies door to door in his town, he made 
        $600, which he donated in the local church. Shortly after that, he started writing songs of his own and 
        posted them to YouTube along with covers of other popular songs.</h6>
    <h6>He started his own channel in September 2009. It was called ‘Charlies Vlogs.’ He began by posting comedy videos with covers. His first music video was released in 2010. Later the same year, he released ‘The Otto Tunes’ his debut Extended Play</h6>

His prize winning entry was a version of Adele's ‘Someone like You’ which he performed with Emily Luther. After enjoying Puth’s performance of ‘Someone like You’, Ellen DeGeneres announced that she had signed him to her label eleveneleven. This proved to be huge turning point in Charlie Puth’s career. It increased his fan base both online and offline, all over the world. According to Puth, it helped him reach a new level, which he thought was beyond him.</h6>

    <h6>His second Extended Play, ‘Ego’, was released in October 2013. He also wrote songs as well as singles for some of his fellow YouTube personalities. He signed with Atlantic Records in early 2015, after which his first song ‘Marvin Gaye’ was released. This song topped the charts in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland as well as the UK. Standing at number 21 on the US Billboard Hot 100, it became one of the most popular works in his career. He appeared in the music video ‘Dear Future Husband’ where he played the love interest of the reputed American singer Meghan Trainor. In the video they are shown meeting on an online dating service, following which Puth comes to Trainor’s home with a pizza. Trainor, who is impressed with Puth, invites him inside.</h6>
