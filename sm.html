      <h1>SHAWN MENDES</h1>
      <img src="sm.png">
      <h6>Shawn Peter Raul Mendes (born August 8, 1998) is a Canadian singer and songwriter. He gained a following 
          in 2013, posting song covers on the video-sharing application Vine. The following year, he caught the 
          attention of artist manager Andrew Gertler and Island Records A&R Ziggy Chareton, which led to him 
          signing a deal with the record label. Mendes's self-titled debut EP was released in 2014, followed by 
          his debut studio album Handwritten in 2015. Handwritten debuted atop the US Billboard 200, making Mendes 
          one of five artists ever to debut at number one before the age of 18. The single "Stitches" reached 
          number one in the UK and the top 10 in the US and Canada. </h6>

     <h6>His second studio album Illuminate (2016) also debuted at number one in the US, with its singles "Treat You Better" and "There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back" reaching the top 10 in several countries. His self-titled third studio album (2018) was supported by the lead single "In My Blood". The album's number one debut in the US made Mendes the third-youngest artist to achieve three number one albums. In 2019, he released the hit singles "If I Can't Have You" and "Señorita", with the latter peaking atop the US Billboard Hot 100. His fourth studio album, Wonder (2020), made Mendes the youngest male artist ever to top the Billboard 200 with four studio albums.</h6>

      <h6>Among his accolades, Mendes has won 13 SOCAN awards, 10 MTV Europe Music Awards, eight Juno Awards, eight iHeartRadio MMVAs, two American Music Awards, and received three Grammy Award nominations. In 2018, Time named Mendes as one of the 100 most influential people in the world on their annual list. </h6>

    <h6>Young, good-looking, and highly talented, Shawn Mendes is a rage among not just the Canadian youth, but also among young people all over the world. Dashing and well-built with a charismatic personality, the teenage singer is also known for his confidence and poise on the stage. Leveraging on his chocolate-boy looks, he has taken on modeling contracts and signed up with modeling agencies to complement his singing career.</h6>
        <img src="transparent2.png">
    <h6>Being a rapidly rising young star, Shawn Mendes has also been involved in several controversies. To promote the sales of his album – ‘Handwritten’, Shawn Mendes encouraged people to buy the album from the stores directly rather than online—for a small chance to meet him. This act was considered by many groups as “unethical” and “exploitative” on his part to enhance album sales. He again courted controversy with the launch of his video ‘Treat You Better’ which focuses on relationships affected by abuse. The video resulted in more than six million views within a few days and was very popular. Mendes encouraged people to look past the dark aspects of his video but the video generated controversy nonetheless. The video was also heavily criticized for focusing too much on domestic violence and Mendes justified that the focus of the video was more on relationships and not so much on the violence within them. </h6>

    <h6>Shawn Mendes was born in Toronto, Canada to a mother who was a real estate agent and a father who was a businessman. He is of mixed ancestry with his mother being English and his father of Portuguese origin. He completed school from Pine Ridge Secondary School and his career in music began soon after. Talks of Shawn dating his collaborator Camila Cabello often make the rounds though he has repeatedly denied that the duo is dating. </h6>
